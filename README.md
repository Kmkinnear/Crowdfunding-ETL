# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Project Overview
Independent Funding has given us a new data set to do more crowdfunding analysis on. We'll be extracting and transforming the data using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook. Then we will use our "backers.csv" file that we created to import into our crowdfunding database that we previously created in the module. From there we can run some bonus queries to create two new tables and .csv files that we can email out to the backers and contacts.
